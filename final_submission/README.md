## Presentation and video

[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NzPMBYzkLNE4eMVxigweLxzwSPdInzYp/view?usp=sharing) and [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tMfVfEvMBNvLaxX5bnqKtUCA83QyDEl3/view?usp=sharing) files was limited by the maximum file size of GitHub.  
So, instead I uploaded them to my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kipgp0WiDwwuUWhFbIZR12t9lgJuEq9A?usp=sharing). If there is any problem accessing these files, please let me know (via my [email](mailto:sihanern.thitisan.593@s.kyushu-u.ac.jp)).

*For presentation file, the font is missing from the preview page in Google Drive.  
However, the font is already embeded inside the file if you download and open it with Powerpoint*

## Code files
