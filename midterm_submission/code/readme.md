# Unnamed Discord bot by Sihanern Thitisan

This is a bot file with a steam module

## Activation

Please insert [Discord token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and [Steam Web API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) into the `.env` file next to `main.py` file.

## Usage

After the activation, simply run the `main.py` file.
Then invite the bot to your discord server.

## Disclaimer

This is only the part of the full bot I have created, other parts were not included in this repository. After creating more features, I might made it open source on my own repository (really far future)
